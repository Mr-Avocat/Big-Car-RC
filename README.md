# Big-Car-RC
I have an Arduino board, some wires, a HC06 bluetooth module, leds, servo-motors, legos and wood. What I'm supposed to do ? A BluetoothC (commanded by my phone) car was the best thing with I can spend my time.
Codes are in "Programmes Voiture BC", for the moment only "voiture_final_boutons" works. "Voiture_RC" makes my servo-motor get sick and the last one is supposed to be the final version, including an electric motor, a track pad instead of buttons and an ultrasound sensor to calculate distance and prevent collisions.
